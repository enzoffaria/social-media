# social-media

currently this is my most recent project.

The design wasn't done by me, but I was pleased that I was able to maintain fidelity and make it responsive.

it lacks some tweaks and a bit of interaction with the page through JavaScript.

I still don't know a solution in JS to "accept or delete requests", nor do I know how to allow comments on publications.

I need to learn DOM for yesterday!
